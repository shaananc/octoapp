Penn Coffee Dates
=======

This app is designed to stimulate real person interaction between students at UPenn.

The process is simple. Sign up and pick one of the three random people presented to go on a Coffee Date with.

The grader username is grader@upenn.edu with password 1234567 - has admin access
Otherwise, feel free to create a new user with a UPenn email.

On picking a date both users receive an email confirmation, each others emails addresses and a link to a when2meet scheduling site.
All the users currently on the site are test users and all the emails redirect to my own email account.
If you want to test the email functionality create a new user with a .upenn.edu suffix. Email me at shaananc@gmail.com if you need this changed.
